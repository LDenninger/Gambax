        "content": "Yes, it is possible to create a listener in a VS Code extension that triggers a specific function when the user presses Enter on a line starting with `#gambas`. You can achieve this by using the `TextEditor` API to listen for key events and check the content of the current line.\n\nHere\u2019s a brief outline of how you can implement this:\n\n1. **Listen for Key Events**: Use the `vscode.commands.registerCommand` to register a command that will be triggered when Enter is pressed.\n\n2. **Check the Current Line**: In the command's implementation, get the active text editor and check if the current line starts with `#gambas`.\n\n3. **Trigger Your Function**: If the condition is met, call your specific function.\n\nHere\u2019s a sample code snippet to illustrate:\n\n```javascript\nconst vscode = require('vscode');\n\nfunction activate(context) {\n    let disposable = vscode.commands.registerCommand('extension.onEnterGambas', () => {\n        const editor = vscode.window.activeTextEditor;\n        if (editor) {\n            const position = editor.selection.active;\n            const lineText = editor.document.lineAt(position.line).text;\n\n            if (lineText.startsWith('#gambas')) {\n                // Call your specific function here\n                mySpecificFunction();\n            }\n        }\n    });\n\n    context.subscriptions.push(disposable);\n}\n\nfunction mySpecificFunction() {\n    // Your function logic here\n}\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    activate\n};\n```\n\nYou would need to bind the command to the Enter key in your `package.json`:\n\n```json\n\"contributes\": {\n    \"commands\": [\n        {\n            \"command\": \"extension.onEnterGambas\",\n            \"title\": \"On Enter Gambas\"\n        }\n    ],\n    \"keybindings\": [\n        {\n            \"command\": \"extension.onEnterGambas\",\n            \"key\": \"enter\",\n            \"when\": \"editorTextFocus\"\n        }\n    ]\n}\n```\n\nMake sure to test it thoroughly to ensure it works as expected in your extension."

        "content": "Yes, triggering a function every time the user presses Enter can potentially introduce overhead, especially if the function being called performs complex operations or if the user frequently presses Enter. \n\nTo mitigate this, consider the following strategies:\n\n1. **Conditional Execution**: Ensure that your function only executes if the current line starts with `#gambas`. This will reduce unnecessary calls.\n\n2. **Debouncing**: Implement a debounce mechanism to limit how often the function can be triggered within a certain timeframe.\n\n3. **Command Context**: Use the `when` clause in the keybinding to limit when the command is active, ensuring it only listens for Enter presses in relevant contexts.\n\n4. **Performance Optimization**: Optimize the function being called to ensure it runs efficiently.\n\nBy applying these strategies, you can minimize the overhead and ensure that your extension remains responsive."
